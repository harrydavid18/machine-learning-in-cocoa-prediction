# 🍫 Predicting Cocoa Yields in Colombia using Machine Learning 🍫 

This repository contains the code and data used for the development of a machine learning model that predicts cocoa production yields in the department of Santander - Colombia. The project is based on historical production data and several environmental variables, with the objective of optimizing planning and decision making in cocoa agriculture.

## 📖 Description 

This project uses various machine learning models, including linear regression, decision trees and random forests, to predict cocoa production in the department of Santander, Colombia. The main objective is to develop tools that allow farmers and decision makers to optimize resources and improve planning in cocoa agriculture.

### 📊 Data Collection 

For the development of this project, an exhaustive collection of data from various sources was carried out:

- **Production Data**: Historical cocoa production data were obtained through the Colombian government initiative [Datos Abiertos](https://www.datos.gov.co/), which provides access to a wide range of data to support evidence-based decision making.
- **Environmental Data**: Environmental data, including climate and weather variables, were collected through the Colombian government agency [IDEAM](http://www.ideam.gov.co/), which is responsible for monitoring and providing information on the environment in Colombia.

All data collection has been stored and is available in this repository for review and analysis.

### 🏋️ Models Used 

- **Linear Regression**: This model is used to establish a linear relationship between the independent variables and the dependent variable, which in this case is cocoa production.
- **Decision Trees**: A non-linear model that divides the data into smaller subsets based on the most important characteristics, creating a decision tree structure.
- **Random Forests**: A set of decision trees that work together to improve accuracy and reduce the risk of overfitting.

### 🎆 Implementation and Results 🎆

The project is carried out through the use of Jupyter Notebooks, where the following steps are performed:

1. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Data are examined and visualized to understand their characteristics and relationships.
2. **Feature Engineering**: Relevant features are created and selected to improve the performance of the models.
3. **Model Training**: Different machine learning models are trained using the prepared data.
4. **Model Evaluation**: Model performance is evaluated using techniques such as cross-validation and metrics such as mean square error (MSE).
